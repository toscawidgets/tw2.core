Description: TW is a web widget toolkit for Python to aid in the creation, packaging and
        distribution of common view elements normally used in the web.
        
        These widgets are portable among any Python web-application framework or
        application that supports the WSGI standard.
        
        Several widget libraries exist which build on top of Toscawidgets to provide
        form controls, sortable grids, maps, charts, etc.
        
        Credits
        -------
        
        ToscaWidgets was originally developed by `Alberto Valverde Gonzalez`_ based on
        the work of the many people involved in developing, testing and designing
        TurboGears' Widgets.  TG Widget's original design was made by TurboGears'
        author, `Kevin Dangoor`_ . **Michele Cella** and Alberto worked hard to push
        TG's implementation to where it now stands.
        
        Several people have contributed to ToscaWidgets itself and external widget
        packages.
        
        Community
        ---------
        
        ToscaWidgets' community interacts in the `toscawidgets-discuss`_ Google Group.
        It's not rare to see discussion in Turbogears and Pylons lists too.
        
        ToscaWidgets documentation, repository and Trac lives at
        http://toscawidgets.org/
        
        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        The test suite can be executed by running the `test` `setuptools` command::
        
        $ python setup.py test
        
        .. warning::
        
        The tests cannot be executed with `nosetests` ATM. This issue is not trivial
        to fix but will be fixed before 1.0
