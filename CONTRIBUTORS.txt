============

* James Gardner has provided invaluable help on designing the HostFramework 
  interface to make ToscaWidgets play nice with WSGI apps/frameworks/Pylons. 
  The wsgi_app.py sample app is largely based on a script of his. He has also 
  provided the RuleDispatch's Win32 egg that lives at "downloads". 
* Matthew Scott has provided a PylonsHostFramework class and very interesting
  feedback from a user-with-no-docs perspective ;)
* Elvelind Grandin has provided good tips on integration with TurboGears, the
  TG extension is his brain-child.
* David Smith has much helped to make unicode support more robust.
* Claudio S. Martinez has contributed some improvements to js.py.
* Florent Aide has fixed some DeprecationWarnings.
* Ian Charnas made widget ids w3c compliant.
* Roger Demetrescu has contributed some developer-friendliness enhancements.
* Paul Johnston has contributed documentation, removed the need for 
  WidgetRepeater.max_repetitions, and provided a number of minor enhancements.

ToscaWidgets is modeled after TurboGears widgets which was initially designed
by Kevin Dangoor and Michele Cella (with a little help from Alberto). Many
people have contributed code, bugfixes and ideas to TG widgets and ToscaWidgets
owes much to them.
