Changelog
=========

0.9.5 (unreleased)
----------------------

0.9.4 (Dec 8, 2008)
----------------------

* Fix to :func:`tw.core.util.unflatten_args` by Philip Charlesworth from #28
* Bumped up Simplejson requirement to > 2.x and updated TWEncoder for 
  compatibility with it.

0.9.3 (Aug 17, 2008)
----------------------

* Added support for TurboGears?-1.5/CherryPy-3.1, thanks to Dag Brattli.
* :func:`tw.api.make_middleware` no longer stacks the RegistryManager by default
  since ususally TW is stacked above a RegistryManager in a larger app.

  .. warning::

     This might break your app if you're not using a RegistryManager in your
     wsgi pipeline. If this is the case you'll notice because TW will complain
     from a 'paste.registry' missing key from environ, if this is the case you
     can fix it by passing `stack_registry = True` as a keyword argument to
     :func:`tw.api.make_middleware` when configuring TW's middleware.

* Fixed a big which caused resources to be injected twice when calling
  :func:`tw.api.inject_resources` twice.
* Greatly simplified :func:`tw.core.resource_injector.injector_middleware`
  thanks to `WebOb`_.
* Optimized :meth:`tw.api.Widget.update_params` logic.

  .. warning::

     There's a slight change in behaviour but it will probably not
     affect anyone: callable parameters passed to :meth:`Widget.display` are no
     longer called automatically since it makes no sense to do so and incurrs in
     a performance penalty.

* Added a ``headbottom`` location where :class:`tw.api.Resource` instances can
  be injected.

0.9.2 (Jun 8, 2008)
----------------------

* Template engine plugins are now loaded lazily.
* The v=modfied_time query string argument is no longer appended to resources
  since this method is not reliable with zipped eggs and causes some trouble.
  As a plus requests should now be faster since there are no disk hits for this
  reason.
* The CP filter in mods.tg now handles staic file serving instead of registering
  directories with CP's static filter so resources from zipped eggs work
  properly.
* Implemented a setuptools commands to copy all static reosurces from
  a series of distributions into a direcory where a fast web-server
  can serve them. Optionally, if YUICompressor is installed, it can
  compress CSS and JS in the destination directory.
* Removed dependency from Paste, changed to lighter WebOb.
* TW's middleware can now serve static resources from zipped eggs.
* feeder.py is no longer included.
* js_function arguments can now include other js_calls and js_callbacks at
  any level of nesting.
* repetitions and template caches are now LRUCaches to set an upper limit on
  memory usage.

0.9.1 (Jun, 1 2008)
----------------------

* made ``inject_resources`` default in middleware since else dynamic js calls
  wont be included

0.9 (Jun, 1 2008)
----------------------

* retrieve_css and retrieve_javascript have been deprecated and now return
  empty lists so resources are not included twice in TG1.
* tw.mods.tg now injects resources with resource injector
* JSLink and CSSLink now allow to override link to specify external resources.
  (Closes #7)
* Removed hard dependency from PasteScript.
* ToscaWidgets no longer has any external dependency with C extensions since
  dependencies on RuleDispatch and PyProtocols have been dropped
* ``display``, ``render``, ``adapt_value`` and ``retrieve_resources`` are no
  longer generic functions but are still exported so they can be easily extended
  with PEAK-Rules if neccesary
* Removed un-needed dependency from decorator module.

0.8.7 (unreleased)
----------------------

* WidgetRepeaters don't have a max_repetitions limitiation anymore since
  repetitions are now generated dynamically. Thanks to Paul Johnston.

0.8.6.1 (May, 29 2008)
----------------------

* Fixed a bug introduced in display machinery rewrite which caused render to
  return Streams and ElementStreams on some circumstances.

0.8.6 (May, 29 2008)
----------------------

* Removed use of RuleDispatch but left the requirement in order not to break
  backwards compatibility. Use of TW's generic functions will issue
  DeprecationWarnings. Please fix your code ASAP (use peak.rules if absolutely
  need gfs) since deprecated code will be removed in 0.9.
* fixed memory leak caused by function closures passed to the template context
  when using genshi.
* injector_middleware now properly handles wrapped apps that use the write
  func returned by start_response
* Docs are finally hitting the repository!
* :func:`tw.core.resource_injector.inject_resources` has changed it's
  signature making ``resources`` an optional parameter and switched places
  with ``html``.

0.8.5 (Apr, 25 2008)
----------------------

* PylonsHostFramework no longer adds the extra_vars_func by default which
  made available Pylons's SOPs in every widget template namespace since some
  widgets are rendered outside the Pylons' app context (ie: resources).
  The best practice to make thsi symbols available on a per-widget base is
  to pass them as parameters when rendering or make use of callables to provide
  params at request time.

0.8.[1,2,3,4] (Apr, 19 2008)
-------------------------------

* Fixed various import bugs introduced in 0.8

0.8 (Apr. 19 2008)
----------------------

* Changed the name of the "toscawidgets" namespace to "tw" and moved all the
  core stuff to tw.core. Now external widget eggs packages get grafted (via
  namespace packages) in the "tw" namespace. Example:
  "from toscawidgets.widgets import forms" now becomes "from tw import forms"

0.3 (Apr. 19 2008)
----------------------

* Removed lxml dependency for resource injection. Now using simple
  regular expressions.

0.2 (Jan. 25 2008)
----------------------

* Configured apydia to generate API docs.
* Links now add a v=%(mtime)d parameter to the URL to help against IEs 
  aggresive cacheing

0.2rc2 (Nov. 19 2007)
----------------------

* Reworded docs/index.txt

0.2rc1 (Nov. 19 2007)
----------------------

* Added a Trove classifier to the PasteScript template.
* Various bugs and rough edges have been polished.
* Upated Pylons utilities to play well with version >= 0.9.6.
* Better support for Mako in Pylons projects.
* Changed the interface of the HostFramework (please read
  http://wiki.pylonshq.com/x/1YGq to see how it is initialized now).
* Added a switch to TGWidgetsMiddleware to use lxml to inject resources in the
  page.
* Removed use of ``DecoratorTools`` in favor of ``decorator`` since it handles
  signature preservation already (no need to reinvent its wheel)
* Refactored rendering behavior of ``Widget`` into ``Renderable`` base class. 
* Changed signature of ``EngineManager.render`` and ``EngineManager.display``.
  WARNING: Custom display rules should be adapted.
* ``EngineManager._initialize_engine`` is now deprecated.
* TG apps can now be mounted at different paths than / and TW's static resources
  will be served properly. Thanks to Noah Gift for reporting the problem.
* Removed DeprecationWarnings thrown by latest RuleDispatch. Patch from 
  Florent Aide.
* In mod.tg: widgets included at ``tg.include_widgets`` are now preloaded on
  first display so their directories get registered with CherryPy. Thanks to
  Dennis Muhlestein for the report and a test app.
* Widgets now support children with ids beginning with an underscore.
* Widgets now allow a callable to provide default values.
* ``js_function`` now allows now properly generates attribute accesses. Thanks
  to patch from Claudio S. Martinez.
* PriorityDisambiguated generic function calls are now logged to aid in tracing
  their execution paths if they're not properly bundled in the same class/module.
* Widgets now support i18n. The translating function is provided by the 
  ``HostFramework`` object at the ``translator`` attribute. To translate
  strings declared at import or initialization time (when translator might not
  be initialized yet), the ``lazystring`` function (adapted form TG) is
  provided.
* ``EngineManager.load_engine`` now accepts a ``distribution`` parameter
  to load an engine from a specific setuptools distribution. 
  WARNING: Former ``load_engine_from_distribution`` is deprecated.
* ``link`` is now a property of ``Link`` which returns it's computed
  url. Note that, ATM, it can only be queried precisely during a request.
* ``displays_on`` and ``engine_name`` can now be passed as arguments to
  ``display``.
* ``pre_init`` and ``post_init`` are no longer generic functions. 
  Pre-initialization is now done in ``__new__`` and post-initialization 
  in ``post_init``, a special method called by a wrapper around 
  ``__init__`` after all cooperative inits have ran.
* Using DecoratorTools to create 2.3 compatible decorators that preserve
  decorated function's signature and docstrings.
* ``WidgetRepeater`` now adjusts it's repetititions automatically based on the
  length of value up to a maximun of ``max_repetitions``.
* ``js_callback`` now accepts a called ``js_function`` as an argument and will
  create a js function that will make the call passed as argument when invoked.
* **python-cjson** no longer required. Substituted by **simplejson** in order
  to avoid dependence on another C extension module. If **python-cjson** is
  installed it will be used instead for performance.
* New IECSSLink and IECSSSource to conditionally include source/links to trick
  dumb IE.
* Links now allow a ``pkg_resources.Requirement`` instance as ``modname`` to 
  point to the root of an egg distribution. Thanks to Robin Bryce.

0.1a1 (Jan. 19 2007)
----------------------

* ToscaWidgets now requires **python-cjson** for encoding of ``js_function`` 
  args.
* ``toscawidgets.js.js_function`` has changed semantics. It's no longer a 
  decorator and no longer lets you adapt values from python to JS manually. 
  It uses ``cjson.encode`` to encode given parameters so more "JS-like" 
  parameters must be passed explicitly.
* The ``tgsample`` sample app now shows rendering on both kid and genshi
  templates. The ``tgsample-genshi`` sample app has been removed.
* Widget templates now have a ``display_child`` function to reduce boiler-plate
  when displaying childs. It takes care of passing the value and args to child
  widgets allowing overrides in the template.
* The engine name of the page root widgets are displayed on can now be 
  overriden for a request by setting the ``toscawidgets.framework.default_view``
  attribute. Frameworks which only instantiate their HostFramework object once
  for the lifetime of the process should take special care (turbogears).
* Widget now has a "displays_on" read-only property that returns the engine
  name of the widget/page the widget should display on. This simplifies much
  display rules.
* ``toscawidgets.resources.Link`` no longer accepts ``modname`` and ``filename``
  as positional arguments. Should pass them as kw. args.
* ``toscawidgets.js_interface`` has moved to ``toscawidgets.js``.
* MochiKit no longer included in core distribution. Now distributed separately
  as twMochiKit.
* Fixed dependencies and requirements and setting 
  http://toscawidgets.org/download/ as the main download location for neccesary
  pre-built binaries. easy_install should be able to do it's magic properly now.
* Form widgets no longer included in core distribution. Now distributed
  separately as twForms (former ToscaWidgetsForms)
* First ToscaWidgets public release.
